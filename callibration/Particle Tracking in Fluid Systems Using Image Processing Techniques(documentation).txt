mainly python is the language going to use
trying to avoid computer vision and machine learning as posible as I can within this project


I aim to develop a Python program to trace particle tracks in a fluid system,

- first, we mix non-interactive fairly visible particles into a fluid that we want to observe the characteristic

- then we take an image sequence of the fluid (in which we observe the characteristics) in action such as how the fluid interacts with obstacles and creates turbulence

- also image of a pure fluid sample will be taken

- then we can apply our image processing technique to trace the paths of the particles

- output will be a diagram of the paths showing the traces of the particle



image processing part

 - we could use image subtraction to select the particles

 - and make clear the images we are taking

 - there might be shots with particles distorted, I might treat them as well with image processing

 - then the particles must be recognized in each image so that we can trace the path accurately

 - finally, there must be a diagram showing the paths of each particle it would be better if we could assign different colors to each track with different colors.
